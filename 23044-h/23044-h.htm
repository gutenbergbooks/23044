<p>These texts of <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i> are from
Volume&nbsp;I of the nine-volume 1863 Cambridge edition of Shakespeare.
The editors’ preface (e-text <a href =
"http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/23041">23041</a>) and the other plays
from this volume are each available as separate e-texts.</p>

<p>General Notes are in their original location at the end of the Folio
text, followed by the text-critical notes originally printed at the
bottom of each page. All notes are hyperlinked in both directions. In
dialogue, a&nbsp;link from a speaker’s name generally means that the
note applies to the entire line or group of lines. The Quarto text is
given separately, after all Notes.</p>

<p>Line numbers&mdash;shown in the right margin and used for all
notes&mdash;are from the original text. In prose passages the exact line
counts will depend on your browser settings, and will probably be
different from the displayed numbers. Stage directions were not included
in the line numbering.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Besides</span> the copies of the <i>Merry
Wives of Windsor</i> appearing in the folios and modern editions,
a&nbsp;quarto, Q<sub>3</sub>, has been collated in these Notes, of which
the following is the title:</p>

<p>The | Merry Wives | of Windsor. | with the humours of Sir <i>John
Falstaffe</i>, | as also, The swaggering Vaine of Ancient |
<i>Pistoll</i>, and Corporall <i>Nym</i>. |<span class =

<p>Q<sub>1</sub> and Q<sub>2</sub> are editions of an early sketch of
the same play. The variations between the text of these quartos and the
received text are so great that collation cannot be attempted. The text
printed at the end of the play is taken <i>literatim</i> from
Q<sub>1</sub>, the edition of 1602, of which a copy is preserved among
Capell’s <span class = "smallcaps">Shakespeariana</span>, and this text
is collated <i>verbatim</i> with Q<sub>2</sub>, the second quarto
printed in 1619. Q<sub>1</sub> was reprinted in 1842 for the Shakespeare
Society by Mr J.&nbsp;O. Halliwell. This text, which differs in one or
two places from Capell’s Q<sub>1</sub>, has also been collated.
Q<sub>2</sub> is given among <span class = "smallcaps">Twenty of the
Plays of Shakespeare</span>, edited by Steevens. Their titles are as
follows:</p>

<p>(1) A | Most pleasaunt and | excellent conceited Co-|medie, of Syr

Enter-mixed with sundrie | variable and pleasing humors of Syr

Marry, this is the short and the long of it; you have brought her into
such a canaries as ’tis wonderful. The best courtier of them all, when
the court lay at Windsor, could never have brought her to such a canary.
Yet there has been knights, and lords, and gentlemen, with their
<span class = "linenum">60</span>
coaches; I warrant you, coach after coach, letter after letter, gift
after gift; smelling so sweetly, all musk, and so rushling,
I&nbsp;warrant you, in silk and gold; and in such alligant terms; and
<a name = "lineII_2_63" id = "lineII_2_63" href = "#appII_2_63">in</a> such
wine and sugar of the best and the fairest, that would have won any

<span class = "linenum">65</span>
warrant you, they could never get an eye-wink of her: I had myself
twenty angels given me <a name = "lineII_2_66" id = "lineII_2_66" href =

sort, as they say&mdash;but in the way of honesty: and, I&nbsp;warrant
you, they could never get her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest
of them all: and yet there has been earls, nay, which is more,
pensioners;
<span class = "linenum">70</span>
but, I warrant you, all is one with her.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Fal.</span>

Marry, she hath received your letter; for the

you, that will not miss you morning nor evening prayer, as any is in
Windsor, whoe’er be the other: and she bade me tell your worship that
her husband is seldom from home; but, she hopes, there will come a time.
I&nbsp;never knew a woman so dote upon a man: surely, I&nbsp;think you
have
<span class = "linenum">95</span>
charms, la; yes, in truth.</p>

to the
<span class = "linenum">105</span>

Windsor leads a better life than she does: do what she will, say what
she will, take all, pay all, go to bed when she list, rise when she
list, all is as she will: and, truly, she deserves it; for if there be a

<span class = "linenum">110</span>

<p><span class = "speaker">Fal.</span>
Why, I will.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Quick.</span>
Nay, but do so, then: and, look you, he may come and go between you
both; and, in any case, have a

I have long loved her, and, I&nbsp;protest to you, bestowed much on her;
followed her with a doting observance; engrossed opportunities to meet
her; <a name = "lineII_2_178" id = "lineII_2_178" href =

largely to many to know what she would have given; briefly, I&nbsp;have
pursued her as love hath pursued me; which hath been on the wing of all
occasions. But whatsoever I have merited, either in my mind or in my
means, meed, I&nbsp;am sure, I&nbsp;have
<span class = "linenum">185</span>
received none; unless experience be a <a name = "lineII_2_185" id =

<p><span class = "linenum">II. 2.<br>200</span>
<span class = "speaker">Ford.</span>
When I have told you that, I have told you all. Some say, that though
she appear honest to me, yet in other places she enlargeth her mirth so
far that there is shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir John, here
is the heart of my purpose: you are a gentleman of excellent
<span class = "linenum">205</span>
breeding, admirable discourse, of great admittance, authentic in your
place and person, generally allowed for your many war-like, court-like,
and learned preparations.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Fal.</span>
O, sir!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ford.</span>
Believe it, for you know it. There is money;
<span class = "linenum">210</span>
spend it, spend it; spend more; spend all I have; only give me so much
of your time in exchange of it, as to lay an amiable siege to the
honesty of this Ford’s wife: use your art of wooing; win her to consent
to you: if any man may, you may as soon as any.</p>

Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have suffered to bring this
woman to evil for your good. Being thus crammed in the basket,
a&nbsp;couple of Ford’s knaves, his hinds, were called forth by their
mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to Datchet-lane: they
took me on their
<span class = "linenum">90</span>
shoulders; met the jealous knave their master in the door, who asked
them once or twice what they had in their basket: I&nbsp;quaked for
fear, lest the lunatic knave would have searched it; but fate, ordaining
he should be a cuckold, held his hand. Well: on went he for a search,
and
<span class = "linenum">95</span>
away went I for foul clothes. But mark the sequel, Master Brook:
I&nbsp;suffered the pangs of three <a name = "lineIII_5_96" id =
"lineIII_5_96" href = "#appIII_5_96">several</a> deaths; first, an
intolerable fright, to be detected with a jealous rotten bell-wether;
next, to be compassed, like a good bilbo, in the circumference of a
peck, hilt to point, heel to head;
<span class = "linenum">III. 5.<br>100</span>
and then, to be stopped in, like a strong distillation, with stinking
clothes that fretted in their own grease: think of that,&mdash;a man of
my kidney,&mdash;think of that,&mdash;that am as subject to heat as
butter; a&nbsp;man of continual dissolution and thaw: it was a miracle
to scape suffocation. And in
<span class = "linenum">105</span>
the height of this bath, when I was more than half stewed <a name =

<span class = "linenum">110</span>
you <a name = "lineIII_5_110" id = "lineIII_5_110" href =

189</a>, but we have left the text of the Folios uncorrected, as the
mistake may have been Shakespeare’s own. It is however possible that a
transcriber or printer may have mistaken ‘Geo.’ for ‘Tho.’</p>

<p>In <a href = "#lineI_3_89">I. 3. 89, 90</a>, on the other hand, we
have not hesitated to correct the reading of the Folio, substituting
‘Page’ for ‘Ford,’ and ‘Ford’ for ‘Page,’ because, as the early Quartos
have the names right, it seems likely that the blunder was <i>not</i>
due to Shakespeare.</p>

Here again, as in line 40, F<sub>2</sub> F<sub>3</sub> F<sub>4</sub>
read ‘good,’ F<sub>1</sub> Q<sub>3</sub> ‘goot,’ but we have not thought
it necessary to do more than give a specimen of such variations. Capell,
in order to make Dr Caius’s broken English consistent with itself,
corrects it throughout and substitutes ‘de’ for ‘the,’ ‘vill’ for
‘will,’ and so forth. As a general rule, we have silently followed the
first Folio.</p>

With regard to this and other passages which Pope, Theobald, Malone,
&amp;c. have inserted from the early Quartos, our rule has been to
introduce, between brackets, such, and such only, as seemed to be
absolutely essential to the understanding of the text, taking care to
give in the note all those which we have rejected.</p>

<p>The fact that so many omissions can be supplied from such mutilated
copies as the early Quartos, indicates that there may be many more
omissions for the detection of which we have no clue. The text of the
<i>Merry Wives</i> given in F<sub>1</sub> was probably printed from a
carelessly written copy of the author’s MS.</p>

Perhaps, as in the <i>Two Gentlemen of Verona</i>, III. 1. 315, and
other passages, some of which are mentioned by Sidney Walker in his
‘Criticisms,’ Vol. II. p. 13 sqq., this vexed passage may be emended by
supplying a word. We venture to suggest ’the revolt of mine <i>anger</i>
is dangerous.’ The recurrence of the same letters <span class =

printer’s eye and cause the omission.</p>

Here again we have followed the early Quartos in reading ‘Brook’ instead
of ‘Broome,’ the name given by Ff Q<sub>3</sub>. That the former was the
original name is proved by the jest in <a href = "#lineII_2_136">II. 2.
136</a>, where the Folios make sheer nonsense.</p>

<p>Mr Halliwell suggests that the following lines, <a href =

were intended to rhyme and therefore favour the later reading. But in
this scene there are no rhyming lines except the couplet at the end.</p>

<p>On the whole, it seems likely that the name was altered in the stage
copies at the instance of some person of the name of Brook living at
Windsor, who had sufficient acquaintance with the players, or interest
with their patrons, to get it done.</p>

Mr Staunton is unquestionably right in supposing that one part of
Evans’s speech is spoken aside to his opponent, and the other part
aloud. It is impossible else to account for the sudden change of tone.
It might have been conjectured that, being a parson, he wished to appear
peacefully minded, and therefore made his offers of reconciliation aloud
and his menaces in an under tone, but Caius’s reply shews that it was
the threat which had been made aloud. Evans’s valour, it would seem, had
already evaporated when he had ‘a great dispositions to cry’ (<a href =
"#lineIII_1_20">III. 1. 20</a>) and, besides, he had just begun to see
that he was being made a laughing-stock. As his former speech (74, 75,)
is also conciliatory, it was probably spoken so as to be heard by Caius
only. He wished to keep up his credit for courage in the eyes of the
bystanders. In the corresponding scene of the first Quartos we have the
words ‘Hark van urd in your ear,’ and the meaning of the text may have
been obscured by some omission in the Folio.</p>

No doubt there is an omission here in the Folio, which may be partly
supplied from the Quarto. But it is probable that Mrs Ford gave a still
fuller explanation of her device and the grounds on which the disguise
was recommended to Falstaff, otherwise Page would not have been so
confident of his falling into the snare.</p>

In the edition of 1778 Steevens reads ‘Ay, sir Tike, like’ ... but it is
clear from Farmer’s note that it should be ‘Ay, sir Tike,’ ... and so it
is corrected in the later Editions of Steevens. In the Edition annotated
by Fanner, mentioned in <a href = "#endnoteV">note V.</a>, we find
another conjecture of his: ‘Ay, sir, if you like,’ ... or it may have
been ‘Ay, sir, an you like,’ for the word preceding ‘you’ has been cut
away by the binder.</p>

<p>The <a href = "#lineV_5_34">stage direction</a> of the early Quartos
is: <i>Enter Sir Hugh like a Satyre, and boyes drest like Fayries,
Mistresse Quickly, like the Queene of Fayries; they sing a song about
him and afterward speake.</i></p>

<span class = "pagenum">256</span>
<a name = "page256" id = "page256"> </a>
<p>The Folio enumerates at the commencement of the scene all who take
part in it, including <i>Anne Page</i>, <i>Fairies</i>, <i>Quickly</i>
and <i>Pistol</i>, and in this place has merely <i>Enter Fairies</i>.
Malone introduced <i>Anne Page as the Fairy Queen</i>, and at the end,
<i>with waxen tapers on their heads</i>. He however still assigned the
speeches 35-39, 53-74, 82-85, and 88-90 to <i>Quickly</i>. Recent
Editors have generally given them to <i>Anne</i>, on the ground that it
is proved by <a href = "#lineIV_6_20">IV. 6. 20</a> and <a href =
"#lineV_3_11">V. 3. 11, 12</a>, that she was to ‘present the Fairy
Queen,’ and that the character of the speeches is unsuitable to Mrs
Quickly. It has been argued, too, that the <i>Qui.</i> of the folios,
line 35, may be a misprint for <i>Qu.</i>, i.e. <i>Queen</i>. This
however is contradicted by the fact that Mrs Quickly plays the Queen in
the early Quartos, and that the recurrence of <i>Qui.</i>, line 88,
proves that the printer of the first Folio used either <i>Qui.</i> or
<i>Qu.</i> indifferently as the abbreviation of <i>Quickly</i>.</p>

<p>Most likely, in this and other respects the play was altered by its
author, but the stage MSS. were not corrected throughout with sufficient
care. This will account for the mistake about the colours ‘green’ and
‘white’ in the final scene, lines 186, 190, 196.</p>

<p>Or we may suppose Mrs Quickly to have agreed to take Anne’s part in
order to facilitate her escape with Fenton.</p>

“The five plays contained in this volume occur in the first Folio in the

<p><b>Early editions</b>:<br>

“Pope was the first to indicate the <i>place</i> of each new scene; as,
for instance, <i>Tempest</i>, I.&nbsp;1. ‘On a ship at sea.’ He also
subdivided the scenes as given by the Folios and Rowe, making a fresh
scene whenever a new character entered&mdash;an arrangement followed by
Hanmer, Warburton, and Johnson. For convenience of reference to these
editions, we have always recorded the commencement of Pope’s
scenes.”</p>
